Try Live at:  https://rock-vs-mine-prediction-app-ubimidzubjwuk46ajdx8mg.streamlit.app/

A machine learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on sonar signal data.

## Dataset
- 60 numerical features representing sonar signal strengths
- Label: `R` (Rock) or `M` (Mine)

## How It Works
1. Input 60 sonar features manually.
2. The model predicts the object type using logistic regression.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
